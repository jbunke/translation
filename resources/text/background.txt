Translation started as a clunky, glitchy proof of concept for my high
school physics class all the way back in 2016. We were given an open-
ended assignment to demonstrate our understanding of the principles of
kinematic and dynamic motion, and naturally, my first instinct was to
make a game.
I've revisited the core gameplay concept twice since, usually as
a warm-up program when I start working in a new programming language or
environment. I've decided to come back to the game once more, to finally
release it in a state that I'm happy with and put it behind me once and
for all. I can only hope you have a fraction of the fun with it that I
have over the years!
